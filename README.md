# Rock, Paper, Scissors
## Abstract
- With a user-friendly interface and interactive icons, this website allows a user to play a game of rock paper scissors against a computer opponent. In the classic game of rock, paper, or scissors, the user’s chosen icon faces off with the computer opponent’s randomly generated icon. The difficult game consists of rock, paper, scissors, tractor, and wheat icons with rock beating wheat, paper beating tractor, scissors beating wheat, and wheat beating rock. After each round of the game, the app displays a message indicating who won and the respective players' wins are increased. The user can switch game boards by clicking the 'change game' button.

## Context:
Rock, Paper, Scissors is my final solo project showcase for Mod 1 at Turing.

## Learning Goals:
- Apply and showcase the concepts I learned throughout Mod 1
- Create a plan of action to break the project into smaller tasks
- Write clean, DRY JavaScript
- Write semantic HTML, and efficient CSS to form a usable user interface
- Build out functionality using functions that follow SRP
- Manipulate the page after it has loaded: adding, removing, and updating elements, first in the Data Model and then on the DOM
- Document changes with atomic commits
Tech used: Javascript, CSS, HTML, Github, VS Code, debugger, dev tools. 
Resources used: MDN Docs, Google, Stack Overflow.

## Wins: 
- Writing concise and reusable functions, many of which pass data through parameters
- Using debugger to isolate and fix errors
- Using bracket notation in several functions, including a function that keeps track of the game logic in an organized way.
## Challenges:
- Learning to group functions when using setTimeout to delay their execution
- Balancing refactoring code for readability and reusability with benchmark completion
- Managing the abstraction of bracket notation
